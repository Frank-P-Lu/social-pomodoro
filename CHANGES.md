# Pomodoro Completion Message - Before & After

## Problem Statement
The original message said "You just focused for X minutes with Y people!" where Y was the total number of participants, which was confusing when you were alone (saying "with 1 person").

## Solution Implemented

### Before
```
You just focused for 25 minutes with 1 person!    # Solo session
You just focused for 25 minutes with 2 people!    # Two participants  
You just focused for 25 minutes with 3 people!    # Three participants
```

### After

#### Solo Session (1 participant)
One of these messages is randomly selected:
```
You focused solo!
```
or
```
Flying solo today - nice work!
```
or
```
Solo focus session complete!
```
or
```
You stayed focused!
```

#### Group Sessions (2+ participants)
```
You focused with 1 other person!     # 2 participants total
You focused with 2 other people!     # 3 participants total
You focused with 5 other people!     # 6 participants total
```

## Technical Implementation

The message is now generated by the `completion_message/2` function:

```elixir
defp completion_message(duration_minutes, participant_count) do
  cond do
    participant_count == 1 ->
      # Random message for solo sessions
      Enum.random([
        "You focused solo!",
        "Flying solo today - nice work!",
        "Solo focus session complete!",
        "You stayed focused!"
      ])

    true ->
      # Message for group sessions
      other_count = participant_count - 1
      "You focused with #{other_count} #{if other_count == 1, do: "other person", else: "other people"}!"
  end
end
```

## Benefits

1. **Solo sessions**: More encouraging and less awkward than "with 1 person"
2. **Group sessions**: Clearer messaging - "X other people" makes it obvious you're not counting yourself
3. **Variety**: Random messages for solo sessions keep the experience fresh
4. **Proper grammar**: Handles singular ("other person") vs plural ("other people") correctly
