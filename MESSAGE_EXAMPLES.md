## Comparison Table

| Scenario | Old Message | New Message |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Solo | "You just focused for 25 minutes with 1 person!" | "You focused solo!" (or 3 other variants) |
| 2 People | "You just focused for 25 minutes with 2 people!" | "You focused with 1 other person!" |
| 3 People | "You just focused for 25 minutes with 3 people!" | "You focused with 2 other people!" |
| 4 People | "You just focused for 25 minutes with 4 people!" | "You focused with 3 other people!" |
| 5 People | "You just focused for 25 minutes with 5 people!" | "You focused with 4 other people!" |

## Key Points

1. âœ… **Solo sessions** get encouraging, varied messages
2. âœ… **Group sessions** clearly state how many OTHER people you worked with
3. âœ… Grammar is correct: "1 other person" vs "2+ other people"
4. âœ… No more confusion about "with 1 person" when alone

## Testing These Messages

To see these messages in action:

1. **For solo messages**: Create a room, start a session alone, complete it
2. **For group messages**: Create a room, have friends join, start session together, complete it

Each time you complete a solo session, you'll get a different random message - try it multiple times to see the variety!
